## Description

In this repository, I am working through many of the examples in the book "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. In the book, Cormen et. all discuss the process of evaluating, selecting, and creating algorithms. They also provide psuedocode for many of the more commonly used algorithms. My goal with this repository is to gain a better understanding of the efficient data wrangling algorithms presented in this book, and convert many of the psuedocode examples into python code. 

## Files included. 
* Algorithms.ipynb:  This file includes my current notes for the text book

## Running instructions.
I plan for this to be more or less a cook book for computational methods. There are no true running instructions other than to find the algorithm which best suits the current task.
